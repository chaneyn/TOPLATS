@section Introduction
 TOPographically-based Land-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme
    for regional and global atmosperic models and
    studies of macroscale water and energy balance
    
@section Operating System
   The current version of the model was developed on linux machines using
Centos    and Fedora. There are no assurances that it will compile or pass all
the tests    on other operating systems. Ongoing development is addressing the
portability    issue.
    
@section Compilers
  The development of the model has focused on using gfortran 4.46 and up.
Special care is being placed on including the object oriented features of
Fortran 2003+. As a result, many features will not compile with previous
versions of gfortran. As we continue development, it is recommended to use the
most up to date gfortran. "Ready to use" binaries can be downloaded at
http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries. The model's portability to other
compilers is currently unknown. In the near future, we will ensure it can be run
on other compilers including ifortran and pgfortran.   

@section InputOutput
The model requires a number of inputs to simulate the hydrologic cycle over the
region of interest. In the next section, we will try to give a thorough
explanation of the input data and parameters to make your life that much easier.
We will discuss the model output when discussing the filenames used for the
output. Note that all image input/output files have the structure of GrADS
binary files used for meteorological studies. This makes the model easily
accesible to the hydrologic/meteorological scientific community.
